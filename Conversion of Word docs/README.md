# Project 2: Conversion of Word documents to the latest Word format

## Project Brief
The company has old Word documents in the version Word 97-2003 (`.doc` files), and requires an automated solution to convert any of the historical Word files to the latest Word format (`.docx`) which will allow the latest Word's features to be used in all documents.

## Project Requirements
- **Contents unchanged**: The original contents and structure of the Word documents must remain unchanged after convertion.
- **All in `.docx` format**: All converted word documents must be `.docx`.
- **Process an entire folder**: The solution should be able to process a specific folder, and should run with folders that have a combination of old or current folders.

## Project Deliverables
- A VBA code solution capable of:
  1. Converting any Word documents to `.docx`.
  2. Preserving the original Word document structure and file name.

# Code 1: Conversion of Word Documents to the Latest Word Format

## Code Description
This VBA script automates the process of converting all Word documents in a selected folder from the `.doc` format to the latest `.docx` format. The original `.doc` files are replaced by the newly converted `.docx` versions.

## Code Features
- **Folder Selection**: Prompts the user to select a folder containing the Word documents for conversion.

## Code Usage Instructions
1. Open Microsoft Word.
2. Access the VBA editor (Alt + F11) and paste the script into a module.
3. Run the script from the VBA editor.
4. Select the folder containing the `.doc` files when prompted.
5. The converted `.docx` files will replace the originals in the same folder.

## Limitations
- **One-Off Execution**: Designed for single-use conversions. For repeated or scheduled tasks, consider automation enhancements.
- **Layout Adjustments**: Minor layout changes may occur during the conversion process, especially with older documents containing complex formatting.
- **File Deletion**: The script deletes original `.doc` files after conversion. Ensure you have backups if required.
